# CV template for XeLaTeX

**Version 5.x.x only works with TexLive 2023.**

![Example](cv-roald-example.png)

This template lets you choose one base color via the `documentclass` option `changecolor`. You can for example use the color of the company you are applying for. By using a color harmony model, a color named `second` is picked. This color is only used for the links. However, if you choose the option `titlecolor=second`, the second color is also used for the titles. See the gif below for a little demo.

By choosing colors according to a color [harmony model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_\(color\)), you make sure the different colors match nicely. You can play around with different models [here](http://paletton.com/). For more information on how this template works, see the comments in `cv-roald-example.tex`.
