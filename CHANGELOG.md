# Changes in version 4
- Removed cell space patch
- Fixed spacing after titles in tex live 2020.

# Changes in version 3
## Big changes
- Added a new `documentclass` option `colorharmony`, which defines a new color using color harmony models. The new color is called `second` and can be used in the document with `\color{second}`. This color is also used for the new `link{}` command, see below.
- Added a new `documentclass` option `titlecolor`, which allows you to set a different color for the titles.
- Defined a new command `\FAspace` which replaces the old length `\FAspace` (and therefore breaks compatibility with the v2 class file). Now you can use `\FAspace` directly in the document, instead of using `\hspace{\FAspace}`.
- Defined a new command `\link{someurl.com}`, which places a fontawesome logo in the document with the link. The color of the logo is detemined using the color harmony models.
- Removed the environment `tabitemize`, since the regular environment `itemize` also works. I don't remember why I implemented `tabitemize` in the first place.

## Small changes
- Reduced the indentation of a bulleted list

# Changes in version 2
## Big changes
- You can change the color of the header and titles using the `changecolor` option. Example: `\documentclass[changecolor={111, 156, 45}]{cv-roald}`.
- You can add a picture to the top right of the page using the command `\photo{filename}`.
- It is no longer needed to start a new table row with `\\[\vspacepar]`, now `\\` is sufficient. The row spacing is now defined globally in the class file.

## Small changes
- Removed a lot of variables from the class file.
- Improved the formatting of the `.cls` and `.tex` files.
